      POWALYZE - STRATEGIC PMO GUIDE 2025
      
      Author: Fabrice Fays
      Date: October 2025
      
      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
      The modern Project Management Office (PMO) is no longer just a reporting entity; it is the strategic navigation system of the enterprise. This comprehensive guide outlines the transition from administrative support to value generation.
      
      CHAPTER 1: THE EVOLUTION OF PMO
      1.1 From Support to Strategy
      Traditionally, PMOs focused on compliance and standardization. In 2025, the focus shifts to strategic alignment, resource optimization, and rapid value delivery.
      
      1.2 The Hybrid Reality
      Most organizations now operate in a bi-modal reality: Agile for software development and Waterfall for infrastructure/engineering. The strategic PMO must bridge these worlds.
      
      CHAPTER 2: IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORKS
      2.1 The Powalyze 4-Step Setup
      - Assess: Maturity assessment using P3M3 model.
      - Design: Tailoring governance to culture, not theory.
      - Pilot: Launching with a lighthouse project.
      - Scale: Rollout across the portfolio.
